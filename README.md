<p>The idea is to do these sessions daily by reviewing and studying concepts day-to-day, which helps my
memory retain information more effectively</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there 
are different ways to solve the same problem. 
Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative toimprove.</p>
